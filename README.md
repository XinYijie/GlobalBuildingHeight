# GlobalBuildingHeight
The project is about the data collection and prepocessing scripts on Google Earth Engine Source of estimating global 30 meters spatiotemporal 3D urban expansion dataset from 1990 to 2010.


## Data Availability
The processed data can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21792209.v2. This dataset contains 621 GeoTiff files, each file contains building height information at 30m resolution and information of the year the building was built from 1990 to 2010 within a 5° grid, which combined can reflect the urban 3D expansion phenomenon. This dataset can be visualized and processed by GIS software (e.g., QGIS and ESRI ArcGIS).
